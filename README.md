# Download-Manager
Python program that manages Downloads 

This is a Python program which manages a users Downloads easily. 

Have you ever downloaded a bunch of files and have to copy and paste them into the desired foler? (ex lecture notes which need to be moved from Downloads into Desktop/LectureNotes).

In Mac you are not allowed to Cut and paste the folders, so the user has to copy, paste, and the move to trash, which is a process. Additionaly, if you want to rename your file, you have to go one by one and rename each file.

Luckily the os library in Python allows for direct access to files and folders, so i tried to make this process easier by creating this program. Below i will explain each function and main lines of code which do this task.

Function 1: main()
